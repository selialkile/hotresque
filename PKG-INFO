        About HotResque
        ==============
        
        HotResque is a Python library that allows you to use `Redis <http://code.google.com/p/redis/>`_ as a message queue within your Python programs.
        
        The main advantage of this model is that there is no queue server to run, other than Redis. This is particularly ideal if you're already using Redis as a datastore elsewhere. To install it, run:
        
        easy_install -U HotResque
        
        The best place to get started is `the documentation <http://selialkile.github.com/HotResque/>`_.
        
        The source code is available on `GitHub <http://github.com/selialkile/HotResque>`_.
